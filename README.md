# UC Tuition Costs Data Science Project

>Personal Note: This was my first project for the UC Santa Barbara Data Science Club. Although the project was initially completed in Spring of 2016, I have since gone back to clean up some of the code and to merge the csv files. As my first attempt at a data science project, the code here is far from perfect. Nonetheless, this project holds a special place in my heart as a reminder of where I started and how much I have learned since those first couple months.

* Initial Completion: 5/9/2017
* Retroactive Completion: 4/24/2018

### Abstract: 
UC Project: An Investigation into the UC system’s enrollment, tuition and spending trends over the past 10 years

### Analyzing: 
*	Student Enrollment 
* Faculty-Student Ratio 
* Tuition Costs 
* Average Income of Americans by Education Level 


**Hypothesis:** <br>
UC tuition costs have more quadrupled in the past 10 years, vastly exceeding inflation rates and, in some cases, surmounting the ROI completely, leading one to question whether a college degree is still worth it's price tag. This project is intended to investigate increases in attendance costs parallel to shifts in household income (and related economic indices) over the past 10 years.

**Motivation:** <br>
UC in-state tuition in 2006 was $2,541 (which would be $3117.27 in today’s dollars, accounting for an averaged 1.88% inflation rate over the 10 year span). In-state tuition as of this year (2017) was $13,500, which is about a 430% increase costs over the span of just 11 years.
